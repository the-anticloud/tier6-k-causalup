## Temporal Commitments

`K_CAUSALUP` is part of a body of work that spans past prior art, present deployment, and future-proof design. These commitments are documented, timestamped, and verifiable.

## To the Past — Acknowledging Prior Art

`K_CAUSALUP` builds on decades of open research. Anticloud FZ LLE explicitly acknowledges:

- The open-source communities whose permissively licensed code enabled this infrastructure
- The researchers whose published papers on transformer architecture, quantization, and compliance frameworks are cited in the AIOSS chain
- The historical record — all Anticloud specifications are archived at Harvard Dataverse (DOI 10.7910/DVN/YMJKOG), ORCID (0009-0009-2233-6107), Zenodo, and the Internet Archive with immutable timestamps

Anticloud's USPTO patent filings for KANTOR K5 and AIOSS include full prior art disclosure. Nothing is hidden.

## To the Present — Current Deployment Integrity

Every running instance of `K_CAUSALUP` in production:

- Generates AIOSS-chained audit entries from the first inference
- Carries a KANTOR K5 post-quantum hash of its deployment package
- Is independently verifiable against published chain hashes
- Operates under Apache 2.0 / Anticommons Enterprise License 1.0

**Current chain hash:** `8b4a8a4f6312dfbe885de8280716985637c163fd2a4b5590341d56db1cc4e560`

## To the Future — Post-Quantum Durability

The KANTOR K5 hash scheme binds five independent inputs using SHA3-256:
```
K5 = SHA3-256(archive_sha3 || file_size_le64 || project_name_utf8 || NULL || timestamp_iso)
```

This construction is designed to remain verifiable against quantum computing attacks decades from now. Future auditors, regulators, and historians will be able to verify the integrity of `K_CAUSALUP` deployments without contacting Anticloud FZ LLE.
