## ISO 27001:2022 + ISO/IEC 42001 — Implementation Strategy

### Information Security Management System (ISMS) Scope
For AI/ML projects, ISMS must cover:
- Model training data and pipelines
- Inference infrastructure
- Developer workstations and CI/CD
- Third-party model APIs (HuggingFace, Kaggle, etc.)

### Key Annex A Controls for AI
| Control | Requirement | AI Application |
| ------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| A.5.1 | Security policies | AI acceptable use policy |
| A.8.8 | Vulnerability management | Regular model security scanning |
| A.8.25 | Secure SDLC | AI security by design |
| A.5.12 | Data classification | Training data sensitivity labeling |
| A.5.37 | Operating procedures | Model deployment runbooks |

### ISO/IEC 42001 (AI Governance) Integration
- Establishes AI management system on top of ISMS
- Risk assessment for AI-specific threats (bias, hallucination, adversarial inputs)
- Organizational roles: AI Risk Owner, AI Ethics Committee

### Conformance Levels
- 100%: Certification-ready
- 83%: Gap analysis complete — remediate missing controls
- 67%: Initial implementation stage
- <67%: Pre-implementation — needs full ISMS scoping

### Quick Wins (highest ROI)
1. Create GOVERNANCE/ folder with AI risk register
2. Document vulnerability management in COMPLIANCE/03_Vulnerability_Management.md
3. Add `.github/workflows/` for SDLC automation
4. Classify all data in anticloud-edits.json
