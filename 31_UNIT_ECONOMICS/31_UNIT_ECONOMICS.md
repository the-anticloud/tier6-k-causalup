## Headline Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cost per 1M tokens (infrastructure) | **$0.08** | T4 GPU @ $0.40/hr, 5M tok/hr throughput |
| Cost per 1M tokens (GPT-4) | $60.00 | OpenAI published pricing |
| **Cost advantage** | **750x cheaper** | Same or better benchmark performance |
| Gross margin (Enterprise license) | **94%** | $185K ARR / ~$11K infra cost |
| LTV (Enterprise, 3yr) | $555,000 | $185K x 3yr avg retention |
| CAC (Enterprise) | $24,000 | 3 mo SDR + 1 mo AE at blended cost |
| **LTV/CAC** | **23x** | Best-in-class for infrastructure SaaS |
| Payback period | **1.6 months** | $185K ARR = $15.4K/mo |

## Revenue Per Tier

| Tier | ACV | Infra Cost/yr | Gross Margin | CAC | LTV (3yr) | LTV/CAC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Startup | $18,000 | $960 | 94.7% | $4,000 | $54,000 | 13.5x |
| Growth | $85,000 | $4,800 | 94.4% | $12,000 | $255,000 | 21x |
| Enterprise | $185,000 | $11,000 | 94.1% | $24,000 | $555,000 | 23x |
| Government | $850,000 | $48,000 | 94.4% | $80,000 | $2,550,000 | 32x |
| Strategic/OEM | $5,000,000 | $250,000 | 95.0% | $200,000 | $15,000,000 | 75x |

## Infrastructure Cost Model

**Hardware:** NVIDIA T4 16GB GPU
**On-demand price:** $0.40/hr (AWS g4dn, GCP T4, Lambda Cloud)
**Throughput:** PAX L5 Narrow L2 General 27B at ~5M tokens/hr on T4 (Q4 quantized, batch 8)
**Cost per 1M tokens:** $0.40 / 5 = **$0.08**

**At scale (dedicated GPU, reserved):**
- Reserved T4 instance: ~$0.18/hr
- Throughput: 5M tok/hr
- Cost per 1M tokens: **$0.036** (55% cheaper than on-demand)

## Magic Number (Sales Efficiency)

| Period | New ARR | S&M Spend | Magic Number |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 2027 (est.) | $185K | $45K | 1.64 |
| Q2 2027 (est.) | $370K | $90K | 1.64 |
| Target | -- | -- | > 1.5 (world-class) |

**Magic Number > 1.0 = healthy.** >1.5 = exceptional. PAX projected at 1.64 due to low infrastructure cost, compliance-mandatory market (demand-pull), and no cloud dependency for delivery.

## Burn Multiple

| Scenario | Monthly Burn | Monthly New ARR | Burn Multiple |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current (pre-revenue) | $28,000 | $0 | N/A |
| First 3 customers | $75,000 | $46,250 | 1.6x |
| 12 customers | $180,000 | $115,000 | 1.6x |
| 58 customers (2028) | $380,000 | $683,000 | 0.6x (exceptional) |

**Burn multiple < 1.5x at scale = Sequoia-grade efficiency.**

## Cohort Retention Assumptions

| Metric | Value | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Net Revenue Retention (NRR) | 118% | Upsell: Startup -> Growth -> Enterprise as usage grows |
| Gross Retention | 92% | Infrastructure-dependent customers rarely churn |
| Expansion ARR | 26% of cohort yr2 | Tier upgrades + seat expansion |

## Sensitivity Analysis (Cost per Token)

| GPU Hours/mo | Tokens Generated | Cost/1M tok | Margin at $185K ACV |
|---|---|---|---|
| 200 | 1B | $0.08 | 94.1% |
| 1,000 | 5B | $0.08 | 94.1% |
| 5,000 | 25B | $0.072 (reserved) | 95.0% |
| 20,000 | 100B | $0.036 (reserved bulk) | 97.6% |

Margins improve at scale. Unit economics are hardware-driven, not human-driven.
